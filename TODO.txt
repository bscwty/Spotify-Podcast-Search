#TODO:
#*highlight result terms
#*Types of search we can do:
# -by show: sort the show based on the result of a query on its name and/or description and content of its episodes. number of results ?
# -by episode: sort the episodes on the result of a query on its name and/or description or its content. number of results ?
# -by content: based on fixed n or automatic, we show list of clips corresponding to the query. Have the possibility of
# going to its show or episode and list all relevant clips from there. Maybe possibility of sorting based on show or episode.
# add top x results as feature (or show pages of results).


#Question:
#clip_num in metadata mapping?
#have metadata as global var in whole project
